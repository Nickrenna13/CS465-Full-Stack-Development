# CS465 Full Stack Development MEAN stack 
# MongoDB | Express | Angular | Node.js
# Architecture
During the full stack application called Travlr Getaways the architecture used for the front-end development include Express HTML, JavaScript and Angular which was used to create a SPA admin only page. The app used Express by modifying it to support a MVC pattern (routes, controllers, views, and data models), and help manage HTTP requests. Express housed the client-facing side of the application by using different frameworks for Node.js. JavaScript was used exclusively for both the front-end and back-end development which makes it easier to maintain the code base and reduces both complexity and repeated code. In the Angular SPA admin only, a page was created to allow an admin to login in to edit and add trips to the application which would then show on the client side after a successful add or edit. The SPA is interesting because it used the user’s browser to support loading pages which can enhance performance. A common issue with SPA’s is the initial load time can be slower but once the pages are loaded the users’ browsers does the work.
The Architecture for the back-ed used a NoSQL MongoDB database for the fact that it fits perfectly with a MEAN stack application. NoSQL uses JSON format documents which is a JavaScript Object Notation, so it works very well with the programming language. During the application development the NoSQL MongoDB database had ease of use, good performance and was perfect for the data that we needed to store such as trips, and a user database. 
# Functionality
Even those JSON format and JavaScript work good together JSON type documents differ from JavaScript because JSON is used with many programming languages not just JavaScript. JSON is more of a formatting style to format data that can work with programming languages by parsing the data and reading the JSON style data. JSON does a good job tying together the frontend and backend development by sending the data from the backend to the front end, then parsing the data to eventually be shown in the view or a client browser. Basically, the data needs to be gotten from the backend database to the HTML client facing page and JSON formatting allows it to be achievable for both the backend and frontend.         
One part in the Express HTML client facing part of the app was common which was the header and footer, as the pages all have the same look and feel. So, with the help from a templating engine called Handlebars we were able to do code refactor to improve the code by limiting the amount in the header and footer. This was also done with data from the trips, the handlebars templating allows the data to display on the HTML pages and can be easily change when as trip package needs to be updated or changed. For example, on the travel page on the website there is no hard coded html present just some templating that gets the information to display from the database using JSON formatting.
# Testing
The HTTP request methods used for this application were GET, POST and PUT. GET was used to display trips from the server to the frontend website. POST was too used to create new data, for instance the create a new trip added to both the database and the application. PUT requests helps the editing part of the admin only page. Two ways to test the HTTP requests that I found helpful were viewing the different output messages in the terminal once a server was running and testing URL paths using Postman, an online tool that testing APIs and URL paths. 
Part of testing was completing testing the endpoints for the POST, PUT and GET endpoints using the online tool, Postman. In the application the creation of routes allows the HTTP requests to be tested and used. An endpoint could be the trip code which was created in a JSON type format for each trip package and would be included in the URL to be tested. For example, “/trips/: tripcode” would be the end point for a URL to testing in a PUT method.  Other end points that required testing were the login and register endpoints which allowed a user to login to the SPA page. The register endpoint would allow the HTTP method to create a POST request to create a new user into the database.
Security was created in the SPA page for logging in to authenticate users. After users are logged in, they would be able to edit a trip or add one to the database, the webpage, and the SPA admin-only page. Testing was completed using Postman and verifying status messages such as 201 which mean creates or a 400 which means a bad request. It is always a good idea to test end points and security endpoints before production. One example of testing the login is to make sure that the add and edit button are not on the SPA screen until a successful login has occurred and to test user registration before the application goes live. In the MongoDB database there is a user database that will house all the potential users that will have access to the application’s admin-only page.  
# Reflection
The full stack development course has helped me reach my professional goals by allowing me to start a software project from start to finish, documenting the process along the way. The full stack application Travlr Getaways has many parts from wiring a database into an application, creating an API to help communication, creating a SPA (whole new app) to security controls to authenticate users. All these newly acquired skills are important in today’s world where there are many applications being used and developed for many companies. My goal is to continue to improve in the full stack development by learning the skills thought is this course and see what else I can create on a MEAN stack application.
